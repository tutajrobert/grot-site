<p>Graphical Resolver of T4s, in short also known as GRoT>, is a computational software based on finite element method FEM applied to linear static calculation of structural strength in state of plane stress or strain. Its most unique function is fun and easy input of geometry of models, that is directly from an image saved as bitmap file and prepared in any graphic editor.</p>

<h2><span>Are you crazy with this name?</span></h2>
<p>Name of the software is an extension, rather quite badly fitted to english, of an acronym GRoT>. This abbreviation was derived from the full former polish name <i>Graficzny Rozwiązywacz Tarcz</i>. Greater-than symbol was added to this acronym, due to the fact that the polish word <i>grot</i> means arrowhead. Word <i>tarcze</i>, which can be translated to english as shields or disks, is a jargon term of 4-node constant strain rectangle elements T4. How to spell that name? Very easy! Just look at IPA pronunciation key <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grot">/ɡrɔt/</a>.</p>

<h2><span>Unique features</span></h2>
<p>Possibilities of the software are presented in the short list below. Every feature, method and piece of code were included in this project, due to particular reasons. If you, fellow reader, are curious about that, do not hesitate to contact with me.
<ul>
    <li>Fun and easy input of geometry of models, that is directly from an image saved as bitmap file and prepared in any graphic editor</li>
    <li>Relly humanalike recognizing of colors, due to RGB to Lab palette conversion</li>
    <li>Constant strain square finite element with four nodes and linear shape functions according to Rakowski, Kacprzyk <i>Metoda Elementów Skończonych w mechanice konstrukcji</i></li>
    <li>Matplotlib coolwarm estethic color map for results viewing pleasure. Fortunately, it is not multicolor <i>jet</i> or <i>rainbow</i> color map, thank you very much!</li>
    <li>First of all steel and thus Huber's strength hypothesis. Von Misos? Excuse me, but who is he?</li>
    <li>Signed Huber results, that is equivalent Huber stress with sign of an axiator of a stress tensor (hydrostatic state)</li>
</ul>

As a geek and enthusiast of all engineering calculations, I would like to, dear reader of this website, talk to you if you have any questions or comments. I work as a FEA and CFD engineer and I spend most of my time dealing with analysis of steel structures and flows in hydraulic equipment. In my freetime I try to force Python programming langauge to cooperate with me in the field of numerical analysis. I will be really happy if you contact me: <a href="mailto:tutajrobert@gmail.com">tutajrobert@gmail.com</a>. I wish you errorless calculations, so that more time will come to consider what is really calculated!</p><footer>Project is maintained by <a href="https://github.com/tutajrobert">tutajrobert</a>.
